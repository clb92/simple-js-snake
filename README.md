# Simple JS Snake

## Description

My own version of the classic game Snake written in JavaScript.

I made this to try object-oriented JavaScript. This is an old project and it's terrible, unobtimized, the controls suck, and the sound effects were generated in [sfxr](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).
