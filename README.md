# Simple JS Snake
My own version of the classic game Snake written in JavaScript.

I made this to try object-oriented JavaScript. This is an old project and it's terrible, unobtimized, the controls suck, and the sound effects were generated in [sfxr](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).

### You can play the game at https://games.clb92.xyz/snake/
